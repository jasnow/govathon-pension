    <p>In most cases, a minimum number of years of service are required to be eligible to receive benefits. Also, your years of service are used to help determine the amount of your benefit. You will receive credit for partial as well as whole years of service when your benefit amount is calculated. Your years of service will include credit for any unused sick time (both regular and reserve) you may have when your benefit is calculated.</p>
    <p>In addition, your years of service may include military service under certain circumstances. If you leave your employment with the City or AISD to undertaken military service and you are later re-employed by the City or AISD, you may be entitled to credit for your military service, if you make all the required employee contributions for this period. You should contact the Pension Department for further information about qualified military service.</p>
